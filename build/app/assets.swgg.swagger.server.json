During this period, the APIs may change in a backwards-incompatible way.  To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header:\n```\napplication/vnd.github.barred-rock-preview\n```\n\nThe Source Import API lets you start an import from a Git, Subversion, Mercurial, or Team Foundation Server source repository. This is the same functionality as [the GitHub Importer](https://help.github.com/articles/importing-from-other-version-control-systems-to-github/).\n\nA typical source import would [start the import](https://developer.github.com/v3/migration/source_imports/#start-an-import) and then (optionally) [update the authors](https://developer.github.com/v3/migration/source_imports/#map-a-commit-author) and/or [set the preference](https://developer.github.com/v3/migration/source_imports/#set-git-lfs-preference) for using Git LFS if large files exist in the import.

At the time of that change, many API clients were already using the existing \"watcher\" endpoints to access starring data. To avoid breaking those applications, the legacy \"watcher\" endpoints continue to provide starring data.\n\nTo provide access to watching data, the v3 Watcher API uses the \"subscription\" endpoints described below.

API on GitHub is currently available for developers to preview. To access the API, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header:\n```\napplication/vnd.github.valkyrie-preview+json\n```\n\n**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).\n\nFor more information about GitHub Marketplace, see \"[GitHub Marketplace](https://developer.github.com/apps/marketplace/).\"\n\n**Note:** This preview includes methods for testing with **stubbed data**. Stubbed data is fake data that's useful for testing your GitHub Apps. Stubbed data is hard-coded and will not change based on actual subscriptions.\n\nTo test with stubbed data, use a stubbed endpoint in place of its production counterpart. This allows you to test whether API logic succeeds before listing GitHub Apps on GitHub Marketplace.\n\nBe sure to replace stubbed endpoints with production endpoints before deploying your GitHub App.\n\nEndpoints for ```/marketplace_listing/*``` and ```/user/marketplace_purchases``` are only accessible by OAuth Apps using ```client_id``` and ```secret``` basic authentication or by [GitHub Apps using a JWT](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authentication-options-for-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app).\n-\n\nFor API authentication for GitHub Marketplace listings associated with an OAuth App, see \"[Authorization options for OAuth Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorization-options-for-oauth-apps/).\"\n-\n\nFor API authentication for GitHub Marketplace listings associated with a GitHub App, see \"[Authentication options for GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authentication-options-for-github-apps/).\"\n\n# [Installations](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/installations/)\n\nFor information on how to authenticate as an installation, see \"[Authentication Options for GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authentication-options-for-github-apps#authenticating-as-an-installation).\"\n\n**Note:** To access the API with your integration, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` Header for your requests.\n\n```\napplication/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json\n```","name":"github-apps","x-swgg-descriptionLineList":["# [GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/)","","For information on how to authenticate as a GitHub App, see \"[Authentication Options for GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authentication-options-for-github-apps#authenticating-as-a-github-app).\"","","**Note:** To access the API with your integration, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` Header for your requests.","","```","application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json","```","","# [GitHub App Permissions](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/permissions/)","","**Note:** To access the API with your integration, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` Header for your requests.","","```","application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json","```","","GitHub Apps are created with a set of permissions.

GitHub then dispatches deployment events that external services can listen for and act on. This enables developers and organizations to build loosely-coupled tooling around deployments, without having to worry about implementation details of delivering different types of applications (e.g., web, native).\n\nDeployment statuses allow external services to mark deployments with an ```error```, ```failure```, ```pending```, or ```success``` state, which can then be consumed by any system listening for ```deployment_status``` events.\n\nDeployment statuses can also include an optional ```description``` and ```target_url```, and we highly recommend providing them as they make deployment statuses much more useful. The ```target_url``` would be the full URL to the deployment output, and the ```description``` would be the high level summary of what happened with the deployment.\n\nDeployments and deployment statuses both have associated [repository events](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#deploymentevent) when they're created. This allows webhooks and 3rd party integrations to respond to deployment requests as well as update the status of a deployment as progress is made.\n\nBelow is a simple sequence diagram for how these interactions would work.\n```\n+---------+             +--------+            +-----------+        +-------------+\n| Tooling |             | GitHub |            | 3rd Party |        | Your Server |\n+---------+             +--------+            +-----------+        +-------------+\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |  Create Deployment   |                       |                     |\n     |---------------------&gt;|                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |  Deployment Created  |                       |                     |\n     |&lt;---------------------|                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Event    |                     |\n     |                      |----------------------&gt;|                     |\n     |                      |                       |     SSH+Deploys     |\n     |                      |                       |--------------------&gt;|\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Status   |                     |\n     |                      |&lt;----------------------|                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |   Deploy Completed  |\n     |                      |                       |&lt;--------------------|\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Status   |                     |\n     |                      |&lt;----------------------|                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n```\n\n\nKeep in mind that GitHub is never actually accessing your servers. It's up to your 3rd party integration to interact with deployment events.  This allows for [GitHub integrations](https://github.com/integrations) as well as running your own systems depending on your use case. Multiple systems can listen for deployment events, and it's up to each of those systems to decide whether or not they're responsible for pushing the code out to your servers, building native code, etc.\n\nNote that the ```repo_deployment``` [OAuth scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) grants targeted access to deployments and deployment statuses **without** granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well.\n\n**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header:\n```\napplication/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json\n```\n\n**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period.

This accomplishes essentially the same thing as merging one branch into another in a local repository and then pushing to GitHub. The benefit is that the merge is done on the server side and a local repository is not needed. This makes it more appropriate for automation and other tools where maintaining local repositories would be cumbersome and inefficient.\n\nThe authenticated user will be the author of any merges done through this endpoint.\n\n# [Pages](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/pages/)\n\nThe GitHub Pages API retrieves information about your GitHub Pages configuration, and the statuses of your builds. Information about the site and the builds can only be accessed by authenticated owners, even though the websites are public.\n\nIn JSON responses, ```status``` can be one of:\n-  ```null```, which means the site has yet to be built\n-  ```queued```, which means the build has been requested but not yet begun\n-  ```building```, which means the build is in progress\n-  ```built```, which means the site has been built\n-  ```errored```, which indicates an error occurred during the build\n\n# [Releases](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/)\n\n**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources.

If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).\n\n# [Repository Invitations](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/invitations/)\n\nThe Repository Invitations API allows users or external services to invite other users to collaborate on a repo. The invited users (or external services on behalf of invited users) can choose to accept or decline the invitations.\n\nNote that the ```repo:invite``` [OAuth scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) grants targeted access to invitations **without** also granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well as invitations.\n\n# [Repository Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/)\n\nThe Repository Webhooks API allows repository admins to manage the post-receive hooks for a repository.  Webhooks can be managed using the JSON HTTP API, or the [PubSubHubbub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#pubsubhubbub).\n\nIf you would like to set up a single webhook to receive events from all of your organization's repositories, check out our [API documentation for Organization Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/hooks/).\n\n# [Statistics](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/)\n\nThe Repository Statistics API allows you to fetch the data that GitHub uses for visualizing different types of repository activity.\n\n####  A word about caching\n\nComputing repository statistics is an expensive operation, so we try to return cached data whenever possible.  If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's statistics, you'll receive a ```202``` response; a background job is also fired to start compiling these statistics. Give the job a few moments to complete, and then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a ```200``` response with the statistics in the response body.\n\nRepository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch, which is usually master; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.\n\n####  Statistics exclude some types of commits\n\nThe statistics exposed by the API match the statistics shown by [different repository graphs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-repository-graphs/).\n\nTo summarize:\n- All statistics exclude merge commits.\n- Contributor statistics also exclude empty commits.\n\n# [Statuses](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/)\n\nThe status API allows external services to mark commits with an ```error```, ```failure```, ```pending```, or ```success``` state, which is then reflected in pull requests involving those commits.\n\nStatuses can also include an optional ```description``` and ```target_url```, and we highly recommend providing them as they make statuses much more useful in the GitHub UI.\n\nAs an example, one common use is for continuous integration services to mark commits as passing or failing builds using status.  The ```target_url``` would be the full URL to the build output, and the ```description``` would be the high level summary of what happened with the build.\n\nStatuses can include a ```context``` to indicate what service is providing that status. For example, you may have your continuous integration service push statuses with a context of ```ci```, and a security audit tool push statuses with a context of ```security```.  You can then use the [combined status endpoint](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#get-the-combined-status-for-a-specific-ref) to retrieve the whole status for a commit.\n\nNote that the ```repo:status``` [OAuth scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) grants targeted access to statuses **without** also granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well as statuses.\n\n**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources.

If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's statistics, you'll receive a ```202``` response; a background job is also fired to start compiling these statistics. Give the job a few moments to complete, and then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a ```200``` response with the statistics in the response body.","","Repository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch, which is usually master; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.","","####  Statistics exclude some types of commits","","The statistics exposed by the API match the statistics shown by [different repository graphs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-repository-graphs/).","","To summarize:","- All statistics exclude merge commits.","- Contributor statistics also exclude empty commits.","","# [Statuses](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/)","","The status API allows external services to mark commits with an ```error```, ```failure```, ```pending```, or ```success``` state, which is then reflected in pull requests involving those commits.","","Statuses can also include an optional ```description``` and ```target_url```, and we highly recommend providing them as they make statuses much more useful in the GitHub UI.","","As an example, one common use is for continuous integration services to mark commits as passing or failing builds using status.  The ```target_url``` would be the full URL to the build output, and the ```description``` would be the high level summary of what happened with the build.","","Statuses can include a ```context``` to indicate what service is providing that status. For example, you may have your continuous integration service push statuses with a context of ```ci```, and a security audit tool push statuses with a context of ```security```.  You can then use the [combined status endpoint](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#get-the-combined-status-for-a-specific-ref) to retrieve the whole status for a commit.","","Note that the ```repo:status``` [OAuth scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) grants targeted access to statuses **without** also granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well as statuses.","","**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources.

Think of it the way you think of performing a search on Google. It's designed to help you find the one result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're looking for). Just like searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few pages of search results so that you can find the item that best meets your needs. To satisfy that need, the GitHub Search API provides **up to 1,000 results for each search**.\n\n####  Ranking search results\n\nUnless another sort option is provided as a query parameter, results are sorted by best match, as indicated by the ```score``` field for each item returned. This is a computed value representing the relevance of an item relative to the other items in the result set. Multiple factors are combined to boost the most relevant item to the top of the result list.\n\n####  Rate limit\n\nThe Search API has a custom rate limit. For requests using [Basic Authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication), [OAuth](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication), or [client ID and secret](https://developer.github.com/v3/#increasing-the-unauthenticated-rate-limit-for-oauth-applications), you can make up to 30 requests per minute. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you to make up to 10 requests per minute.\n\nSee the [rate limit documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) for details on determining your current rate limit status.\n\n####  Timeouts and incomplete results\n\nTo keep the Search API fast for everyone, we limit how long any individual query can run. For queries that [exceed the time limit](https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-04-07-understanding-search-results-and-potential-timeouts/), the API returns the matches that were already found prior to the timeout, and the response has the ```incomplete_results``` property set to ```true```.\n\nReaching a timeout does not necessarily mean that search results are incomplete. More results might have been found, but also might not.\n\n# [Legacy Search](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/legacy/)\n\nThis is a listing of the Legacy Search API features from API v2 that have been ported to API v3. There should be no changes, other than the new URL and JSON output format.\n\n####  Legacy Search API is Deprecated\n\nThe Legacy Search API (described below) is deprecated.

If no new events have been triggered, you will see a \"304 Not Modified\" response, and your current rate limit will be untouched.  There is also an \"X-Poll-Interval\" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll.  In times of high server load, the time may increase.  Please obey the header.\n```\ncurl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nX-Poll-Interval: 60\nETag: \"a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3\"\n# The quotes around the ETag value are important\ncurl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events \\\n   -H 'If-None-Match: \"a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3\"'\nHTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\nX-Poll-Interval: 60\n```\n\n\nEvents support [pagination](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination), however the ```per_page``` option is unsupported. The fixed page size is 30 items. Fetching up to ten pages is supported, for a total of 300 events.\n\nOnly events created within the past 90 days will be included in timelines. Events older than 90 days will not be included (even if the total number of events in the timeline is less than 300).\n\nAll Events have the same response format:\n```\nStatus: 200 OK\nLink: &lt;https://api.github.com/resource?page=2&gt;; rel=\"next\",\n      &lt;https://api.github.com/resource?page=5&gt;; rel=\"last\"\n```\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"Event\",\n    \"public\": true,\n    \"payload\": {\n    },\n    \"repo\": {\n      \"id\": 3,\n      \"name\": \"octocat/Hello-World\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World\"\n    },\n    \"actor\": {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"login\": \"octocat\",\n      \"gravatar_id\": \"\",\n      \"avatar_url\": \"https://github.com/images/error/octocat_happy.gif\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.github.com/users/octocat\"\n    },\n    \"org\": {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"login\": \"github\",\n      \"gravatar_id\": \"\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.github.com/orgs/github\",\n      \"avatar_url\": \"https://github.com/images/error/octocat_happy.gif\"\n    },\n    \"created_at\": \"2011-09-06T17:26:27Z\",\n    \"id\": \"12345\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# [Feeds](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/feeds/)\n\nno description\n\n# [Notifications](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/notifications/)\n\nUsers receive notifications for conversations in repositories they watch including:\n- Issues and their comments\n- Pull Requests and their comments\n- Comments on any commits\n\nNotifications are also sent for conversations in unwatched repositories when the user is involved including:\n- **@mentions**\n- Issue assignments\n- Commits the user authors or commits\n- Any discussion in which the user actively participates\n\nAll Notification API calls require the ```notifications``` or ```repo``` API scopes.  Doing this will give read-only access to some Issue/Commit content. You will still need the \"repo\" scope to access Issues and Commits from their respective endpoints.\n\nNotifications come back as \"threads\".  A Thread contains information about the current discussion of an Issue/PullRequest/Commit.\n\nNotifications are optimized for polling with the \"Last-Modified\" header.  If there are no new notifications, you will see a \"304 Not Modified\" response, leaving your current rate limit untouched.  There is an \"X-Poll-Interval\" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll.  In times of high server load, the time may increase.

Stars are shown next to repositories to show an approximate level of interest.  Stars have no effect on notifications or the activity feed.  For that, see [Repository Watching](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/watching).\n\n####  Starring vs. Watching\n\nIn August 2012, we [changed the way watching works](https://github.com/blog/1204-notifications-stars) on GitHub.  Many API client applications may be using the original \"watcher\" endpoints for accessing this data. You can now start using the \"star\" endpoints instead (described below). Check out the [Watcher API Change post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2012-09-05-watcher-api/) for more details.\n\n# [Watching](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/watching/)\n\nWatching a Repository registers the user to receive notifications on new discussions, as well as events in the user's activity feed.  See [Repository Starring](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/starring) for simple repository bookmarks.\n\n####  Watching vs. Starring\n\nIn August 2012, we [changed the way watching works](https://github.com/blog/1204-notifications-stars) on GitHub.  At the time of that change, many API clients were already using the existing \"watcher\" endpoints to access starring data. To avoid breaking those applications, the legacy \"watcher\" endpoints continue to provide starring data.\n\nTo provide access to watching data, the v3 Watcher API uses the \"subscription\" endpoints described below.

API on GitHub is currently available for developers to preview. To access the API, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header:\n```\napplication/vnd.github.valkyrie-preview+json\n```\n\n**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).\n\nFor more information about GitHub Marketplace, see \"[GitHub Marketplace](https://developer.github.com/apps/marketplace/).\"\n\n**Note:** This preview includes methods for testing with **stubbed data**. Stubbed data is fake data that's useful for testing your GitHub Apps. Stubbed data is hard-coded and will not change based on actual subscriptions.\n\nTo test with stubbed data, use a stubbed endpoint in place of its production counterpart. This allows you to test whether API logic succeeds before listing GitHub Apps on GitHub Marketplace.\n\nBe sure to replace stubbed endpoints with production endpoints before deploying your GitHub App.\n\nEndpoints for ```/marketplace_listing/*``` and ```/user/marketplace_purchases``` are only accessible by OAuth Apps using ```client_id``` and ```secret``` basic authentication or by [GitHub Apps using a JWT](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authentication-options-for-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app).\n-\n\nFor API authentication for GitHub Marketplace listings associated with an OAuth App, see \"[Authorization options for OAuth Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorization-options-for-oauth-apps/).\"\n-\n\nFor API authentication for GitHub Marketplace listings associated with a GitHub App, see \"[Authentication options for GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authentication-options-for-github-apps/).\"\n\n# [Installations](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/installations/)\n\nFor information on how to authenticate as an installation, see \"[Authentication Options for GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authentication-options-for-github-apps#authenticating-as-an-installation).\"\n\n**Note:** To access the API with your integration, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` Header for your requests.\n\n```\napplication/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json\n```","x-swgg-descriptionLineList":["# [GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/)","","For information on how to authenticate as a GitHub App, see \"[Authentication Options for GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authentication-options-for-github-apps#authenticating-as-a-github-app).\"","","**Note:** To access the API with your integration, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` Header for your requests.","","```","application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json","```","","# [GitHub App Permissions](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/permissions/)","","**Note:** To access the API with your integration, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` Header for your requests.","","```","application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json","```","","GitHub Apps are created with a set of permissions.

GitHub then dispatches deployment events that external services can listen for and act on. This enables developers and organizations to build loosely-coupled tooling around deployments, without having to worry about implementation details of delivering different types of applications (e.g., web, native).\n\nDeployment statuses allow external services to mark deployments with an ```error```, ```failure```, ```pending```, or ```success``` state, which can then be consumed by any system listening for ```deployment_status``` events.\n\nDeployment statuses can also include an optional ```description``` and ```target_url```, and we highly recommend providing them as they make deployment statuses much more useful. The ```target_url``` would be the full URL to the deployment output, and the ```description``` would be the high level summary of what happened with the deployment.\n\nDeployments and deployment statuses both have associated [repository events](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#deploymentevent) when they're created. This allows webhooks and 3rd party integrations to respond to deployment requests as well as update the status of a deployment as progress is made.\n\nBelow is a simple sequence diagram for how these interactions would work.\n```\n+---------+             +--------+            +-----------+        +-------------+\n| Tooling |             | GitHub |            | 3rd Party |        | Your Server |\n+---------+             +--------+            +-----------+        +-------------+\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |  Create Deployment   |                       |                     |\n     |---------------------&gt;|                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |  Deployment Created  |                       |                     |\n     |&lt;---------------------|                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Event    |                     |\n     |                      |----------------------&gt;|                     |\n     |                      |                       |     SSH+Deploys     |\n     |                      |                       |--------------------&gt;|\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Status   |                     |\n     |                      |&lt;----------------------|                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |                       |   Deploy Completed  |\n     |                      |                       |&lt;--------------------|\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n     |                      |   Deployment Status   |                     |\n     |                      |&lt;----------------------|                     |\n     |                      |                       |                     |\n```\n\n\nKeep in mind that GitHub is never actually accessing your servers. It's up to your 3rd party integration to interact with deployment events.  This allows for [GitHub integrations](https://github.com/integrations) as well as running your own systems depending on your use case. Multiple systems can listen for deployment events, and it's up to each of those systems to decide whether or not they're responsible for pushing the code out to your servers, building native code, etc.\n\nNote that the ```repo_deployment``` [OAuth scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) grants targeted access to deployments and deployment statuses **without** granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well.\n\n**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header:\n```\napplication/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json\n```\n\n**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).\n\n# [Downloads](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/downloads/)\n\nThe Downloads API (described below) was [deprecated on December 11, 2012](https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads). It will be removed at a future date.\n\nWe recommend using [Releases](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/) instead.\n\nThe downloads API is for package downloads only.

This accomplishes essentially the same thing as merging one branch into another in a local repository and then pushing to GitHub. The benefit is that the merge is done on the server side and a local repository is not needed. This makes it more appropriate for automation and other tools where maintaining local repositories would be cumbersome and inefficient.\n\nThe authenticated user will be the author of any merges done through this endpoint.\n\n# [Pages](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/pages/)\n\nThe GitHub Pages API retrieves information about your GitHub Pages configuration, and the statuses of your builds. Information about the site and the builds can only be accessed by authenticated owners, even though the websites are public.\n\nIn JSON responses, ```status``` can be one of:\n-  ```null```, which means the site has yet to be built\n-  ```queued```, which means the build has been requested but not yet begun\n-  ```building```, which means the build is in progress\n-  ```built```, which means the site has been built\n-  ```errored```, which indicates an error occurred during the build\n\n# [Releases](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/)\n\n**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources.

To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header:\n```\napplication/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json\n```\n\n**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).\n\n# [Repository Invitations](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/invitations/)\n\nThe Repository Invitations API allows users or external services to invite other users to collaborate on a repo. The invited users (or external services on behalf of invited users) can choose to accept or decline the invitations.\n\nNote that the ```repo:invite``` [OAuth scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) grants targeted access to invitations **without** also granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well as invitations.\n\n# [Repository Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/)\n\nThe Repository Webhooks API allows repository admins to manage the post-receive hooks for a repository.  Webhooks can be managed using the JSON HTTP API, or the [PubSubHubbub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#pubsubhubbub).\n\nIf you would like to set up a single webhook to receive events from all of your organization's repositories, check out our [API documentation for Organization Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/hooks/).\n\n# [Statistics](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/)\n\nThe Repository Statistics API allows you to fetch the data that GitHub uses for visualizing different types of repository activity.\n\n####  A word about caching\n\nComputing repository statistics is an expensive operation, so we try to return cached data whenever possible.  If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's statistics, you'll receive a ```202``` response; a background job is also fired to start compiling these statistics. Give the job a few moments to complete, and then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a ```200``` response with the statistics in the response body.\n\nRepository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch, which is usually master; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.\n\n####  Statistics exclude some types of commits\n\nThe statistics exposed by the API match the statistics shown by [different repository graphs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-repository-graphs/).\n\nTo summarize:\n- All statistics exclude merge commits.\n- Contributor statistics also exclude empty commits.\n\n# [Statuses](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/)\n\nThe status API allows external services to mark commits with an ```error```, ```failure```, ```pending```, or ```success``` state, which is then reflected in pull requests involving those commits.\n\nStatuses can also include an optional ```description``` and ```target_url```, and we highly recommend providing them as they make statuses much more useful in the GitHub UI.\n\nAs an example, one common use is for continuous integration services to mark commits as passing or failing builds using status.  The ```target_url``` would be the full URL to the build output, and the ```description``` would be the high level summary of what happened with the build.\n\nStatuses can include a ```context``` to indicate what service is providing that status. For example, you may have your continuous integration service push statuses with a context of ```ci```, and a security audit tool push statuses with a context of ```security```.  You can then use the [combined status endpoint](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#get-the-combined-status-for-a-specific-ref) to retrieve the whole status for a commit.\n\nNote that the ```repo:status``` [OAuth scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) grants targeted access to statuses **without** also granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well as statuses.\n\n**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources.

Give the job a few moments to complete, and then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a ```200``` response with the statistics in the response body.","","Repository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch, which is usually master; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.","","####  Statistics exclude some types of commits","","The statistics exposed by the API match the statistics shown by [different repository graphs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-repository-graphs/).","","To summarize:","- All statistics exclude merge commits.","- Contributor statistics also exclude empty commits.","","# [Statuses](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/)","","The status API allows external services to mark commits with an ```error```, ```failure```, ```pending```, or ```success``` state, which is then reflected in pull requests involving those commits.","","Statuses can also include an optional ```description``` and ```target_url```, and we highly recommend providing them as they make statuses much more useful in the GitHub UI.","","As an example, one common use is for continuous integration services to mark commits as passing or failing builds using status.  The ```target_url``` would be the full URL to the build output, and the ```description``` would be the high level summary of what happened with the build.","","Statuses can include a ```context``` to indicate what service is providing that status. For example, you may have your continuous integration service push statuses with a context of ```ci```, and a security audit tool push statuses with a context of ```security```.  You can then use the [combined status endpoint](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#get-the-combined-status-for-a-specific-ref) to retrieve the whole status for a commit.","","Note that the ```repo:status``` [OAuth scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) grants targeted access to statuses **without** also granting access to repository code, while the ```repo``` scope grants permission to code as well as statuses.","","**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details.

Think of it the way you think of performing a search on Google. It's designed to help you find the one result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're looking for). Just like searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few pages of search results so that you can find the item that best meets your needs. To satisfy that need, the GitHub Search API provides **up to 1,000 results for each search**.\n\n####  Ranking search results\n\nUnless another sort option is provided as a query parameter, results are sorted by best match, as indicated by the ```score``` field for each item returned. This is a computed value representing the relevance of an item relative to the other items in the result set. Multiple factors are combined to boost the most relevant item to the top of the result list.\n\n####  Rate limit\n\nThe Search API has a custom rate limit. For requests using [Basic Authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication), [OAuth](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication), or [client ID and secret](https://developer.github.com/v3/#increasing-the-unauthenticated-rate-limit-for-oauth-applications), you can make up to 30 requests per minute. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you to make up to 10 requests per minute.\n\nSee the [rate limit documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) for details on determining your current rate limit status.\n\n####  Timeouts and incomplete results\n\nTo keep the Search API fast for everyone, we limit how long any individual query can run. For queries that [exceed the time limit](https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-04-07-understanding-search-results-and-potential-timeouts/), the API returns the matches that were already found prior to the timeout, and the response has the ```incomplete_results``` property set to ```true```.\n\nReaching a timeout does not necessarily mean that search results are incomplete. More results might have been found, but also might not.\n\n# [Legacy Search](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/legacy/)\n\nThis is a listing of the Legacy Search API features from API v2 that have been ported to API v3. There should be no changes, other than the new URL and JSON output format.\n\n####  Legacy Search API is Deprecated\n\nThe Legacy Search API (described below) is deprecated. We recommend using the [v3 Search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/) instead. It contains new endpoints and much more functionality.","x-swgg-descriptionLineList":["# [Search](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/)","","**Note:** The ```topics``` property for repositories on GitHub is currently available for developers to preview.

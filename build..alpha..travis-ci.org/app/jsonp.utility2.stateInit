For example, it will change the bare Subversion username ```hubot``` into something like ```hubot &lt;hubot@12341234-abab-fefe-8787-fedcba987654&gt;```.\",\n                    \"\",\n                    \"This API method and the \\\"Map a commit author\\\" method allow you to provide correct Git author information.\"\n                ],\n                \"x-swgg-host\": \"api.github.com\",\n                \"x-swgg-schemes\": [\n                    \"https\"\n                ],\n                \"x-swgg-sortValue\": \"[Source Imports](https://developer.github.com/v3/migration/source_imports/#get-commit-authors) - Get commit authors\",\n                \"x-swgg-tags0\": \"github-migration\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"/repos/{owner}/{repo}/import/authors/{author_id}\": {\n            \"patch\": {\n                \"operationId\": \"_2Frepos_2F_7Bowner_7D_2F_7Brepo_7D_2Fimport_2Fauthors_2F_7Bauthor_id_7D_20PATCH\",\n                \"parameters\": [\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/parameters/github-all.key\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"$ref\": \"#/parameters/github-all.user-agent\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"collectionFormat\": \"csv\",\n                        \"enum\": [\n                            \"application/vnd.github.barred-rock-preview\",\n                            \"application/vnd.github.v3+json\"\n                        ],\n                        \"in\": \"header\",\n                        \"items\": {\n                            \"type\": \"string\"\n                        },\n                        \"name\": \"accept\",\n                        \"type\": \"array\",\n                        \"x-swgg-descriptionLineList\": [\n                            \"https://developer.github.com/v3/media/\",\n                            \"\",\n                            \"Custom media types are used in the API to let consumers choose the format of the data they wish to receive.
